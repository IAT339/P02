                        <p class="desc"> Fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms brings a mix of cheesy, creamy and earthy flavors together.
                         It's a restaurant-worthy dish you can totally make at home. <br><br>
                         If you’re a beginner cook, or even an intermediate one, it may not cross your mind to try making alfredo sauce
                         from scratch. For me, it seemed just a tiny bit out of reach for years. Then one day, I gave it a try and quickly
                         found myself saying, “Oh. That was really easy.” <br><br>
                         Alfredo is one of the most underrated sauces—it’s made with just a few pantry staples, it’s always satisfying, and
                         it’s surprisingly easy to make at home.
                         Every home cook should have a recipe at the ready for quick weeknight dinners. It’s certainly not just for
                         restaurant dining!</p>

                <h3>ingredients</h3>
                <div class="container-flex">
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>8 ounces baby cremini mushrooms, sliced</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                1. Cook the mushrooms: Melt the butter in a deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook
                for 6 to 8 minutes until they have released their liquid and become tender. Season with salt and pepper
                (give one a taste!).    <br><br>
                2. Add the flour: Add the flour to the pot and stir it in to coat the mushrooms. The flour will form a paste on
                the mushrooms and the pan will look quite dry. Cook for a minute and turn heat down to low. <br><br>
                3. Make the sauce: Slowly add the milk while stirring; the flour will dissolve in the milk. If any lumps of flour form,
                break them up against the side of the pan with the back of your spoon. Simmer for 1 to 2 minutes until the sauce has
                thickened slightly, and then add Parmesan cheese. <br><br>

                Lower the heat, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve, up to 10 minutes. If the sauce thickens too much before
                you’re ready to serve, add a splash of milk to thin it out again.
